# Road-Fighter
#Developed game in Quartus using SystemVerilog and FPGA.
#A single player takes control of a car, maneuvering through a dynamically scrolling road teeming with various vehicles and obstacles.
#The objective of Road Fighter is to avoid collisions with other cars and obstacles on the road. Players can accelerate, decelerate, and move left or right to dodge traffic and obstacles. The game becomes progressively more challenging as players advance, with increasing traffic density and obstacles.
